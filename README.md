# MyStanfordApp
Android app for use around Stanford campus. There was a Stanford app on the Play store but it was withdrawn last year. When wandering around campus there are some sites that I constantly have to check, things like the bus timetable or dining hall hours or the campus map. I put these all into one app so that its easier for you to find these and they're in one place. It is built using Android Studio.
